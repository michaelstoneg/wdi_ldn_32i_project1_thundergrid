#Grid of Fire!!!

##What is it?
Grid of fire is a grid based fighting game with simple combat mechanics that emphasizes timing and persistence.

The Grid of Fire is a gladiatorial arena where 2 fighters face off to the death. One hit means one kill.

###How does it work?

- Choose between 3 x 3 or 6 x 6 grid arenas. Be warned, the smaller the space, the bigger the challenge. 

- Move around the grid with the directional keys. The direction you are facing is very important. If it is different from the direction you'd like to go in, you have to turn around first. Make use of the space you're given. Retreating is just as important as advancing.

-Be careful of the top and bottom sides of the arena as moving past them means dying a firey death.

- Attacking and defending are indicated by red and blue character highligths respectively.

- If you're attacking, you are vulnerable. Likewise, if you're defending, you cannot attack. Timing is of the uttmost importance.

- Everytime you kill, you rack up points. After a certain amount of blood has been spilt, the gods of war will gift you special items. Each has it's advantages and disadvantages. Choose wisely.

- Most importantly, never give up. The tide of battle can change at any time.

###How it came to be? 

- This game was my 1st project for the web development immersive program at General Assembly.

- It is a simplified version of the core mechanic of the game of my dreams so I hope you enjoy.

- I planned it for a day and a half before diving in making countless diagrams about how I wanted movement and combat to function. Running scenarios with every permutation I could think of.

- After 2 days, the core of the game had been completed. After which point new features were added. Some of these were at first game breaking but were eventually fixed.

- From there, the fine details of feedback for users was implemented such as sound effects and colors.

- Items came next for the sake of chaos and fun.

- Finally an option screen, reset button, and instructions were added. 

- Of course there were challenges. First of which was having two of each piece of code. One for each player. I solved this issue by creating player objects and variables for current and alternate players.
